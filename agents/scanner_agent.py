1. Select the situations with the most unusual, non-typical, or potentially concerning movement patterns.  
2. Return either a "normal" or "anomalous" result, strictly when confident.  
3. Ensure the structured output includes:  
   - "situation_description": A concise and clear summary of the situation in 4-5 sentences. Focus solely on describing events and their significance.  
   - "result": Either "normal" or "anomalous".  
   - "start_timestamp" and "end_timestamp": Exact timestamps from the logs marking the situationâ€™s beginning and end.  
   - "details": a list of log entries that describe the situation that occured between the identified start and end timestamps. Each log entry should include the original details such as {"timestamp": 1737900000, "room": "pillbox", "nodeId": 1, "onOff": true}

**Important rules:**  

- Do not mention specific times or dates in the situation description unless they are fully aligned with the given start and end timestamps.  
- If times are included, ensure they match the provided start and end timestamps after conversion to human-readable format.  
- Respond only when highly confident about the situation's result and timestamp accuracy.  
- When returning the details of the situation, ensure that the log entries are escaped appropriately to allow these events to be easily parsed into json.
- Only include 1 situation in the response.

The output format should strictly be:  

{
  "situations": [
    {
      "situation_description": "Summary of the most concerning situation based only on log events.",
      "result": "normal | anomalous",
      "start_timestamp": "exact log entry timestamp marking the start",
      "end_timestamp": "exact log entry timestamp marking the end",
